counsel
=====

counsel is a web tracker for low-volume web properties.

How it works:

1. Create a tracking pixel, embed it into an estate (a web property e.g. your personal website).
2. Install my mobile app
3. Receive push notifications when people visit your estate!

Starting April 2017, I will begin accepting requests for user accounts.
