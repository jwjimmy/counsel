counsel
=====

counsel gives you real-time insights on who is visiting your web properties by notifying your phone whenever you get a visit.

How it works:

1. Create a tracking pixel in counsel
2. Embed your tracking pixel in your estate (a web property e.g. your personal website).
2. Install the mobile app (coming to Play Store in July 2017)
3. Receive push notifications whenever people visit your estate!

Starting April 2017, I will begin accepting requests for beta tester accounts.
